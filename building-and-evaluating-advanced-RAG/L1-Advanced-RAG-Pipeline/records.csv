Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field.

While the \nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing \u2014 \nand coursework is an efficient way to master them \u2014 beyond these \nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project\u2019s \ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \nwhen you don\u2019t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \nwho have them. Things you\u2019ve worked on may be significantly different \nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you\u2019re more likely to have to \neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: CHAPTER 1\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and \nallies who can help you \u2014 and who you strive to help \u2014 makes the path easier. This is true whether \nyou\u2019re taking your first steps or you\u2019ve been on the journey for years.LEARNING\nPROJECTS\nJOB\n\nPAGE 8Learning Technical \nSkills for a Promising \nAI CareerCHAPTER 2\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 9In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I\u2019d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \nlearning foundational skills.\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \nlearning, it\u2019s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \ncareer in machine learning are:\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it\u2019s important to understand models such \nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \ndetection. Beyond specific models, it\u2019s even more important to understand the core concepts \nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it\u2019s hard to excel \nin the field without some understanding of it! It\u2019s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \nsequence models, and transformers.\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \nto implement complex AI systems."", ""start_char_idx"": 3787, ""end_char_idx"": 8094, ""text_template"": ""{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"", ""metadata_template"": ""{key}: {value}"",

While the \nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing \u2014 \nand coursework is an efficient way to master them \u2014 beyond these \nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project\u2019s \ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \nwhen you don\u2019t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \nwho have them. Things you\u2019ve worked on may be significantly different \nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you\u2019re more likely to have to \neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: CHAPTER 1\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and \nallies who can help you \u2014 and who you strive to help \u2014 makes the path easier. This is true whether \nyou\u2019re taking your first steps or you\u2019ve been on the journey for years.LEARNING\nPROJECTS\nJOB\n\nPAGE 8Learning Technical \nSkills for a Promising \nAI CareerCHAPTER 2\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 9In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I\u2019d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \nlearning foundational skills.\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \nlearning, it\u2019s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \ncareer in machine learning are:\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it\u2019s important to understand models such \nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \ndetection. Beyond specific models, it\u2019s even more important to understand the core concepts \nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it\u2019s hard to excel \nin the field without some understanding of it! It\u2019s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \nsequence models, and transformers.\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \nto implement complex AI systems."", ""start_char_idx"": 3787, ""end_char_idx"": 8094, ""text_template"": ""{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"", ""metadata_template"": ""{key}: {value}"", ""metadata_seperator"": ""\n""}, ""score"": 0.7856001928496299}], ""error"": null, ""perf"": {""start_time"": ""2023-12-04T21:57:13.865048"", ""end_time"": ""2023-12-04T21:57:15.605242""}, ""pid"": 27527, ""tid"": 982873}, {""stack"": [{""path"": ""app"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""RetrieverQueryEngine"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.query_engine"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.query_engine.retriever_query_engine""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569370214352}, ""name"": ""query""}}, {""path"": ""app._response_synthesizer"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""CompactAndRefine"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers.compact_and_refine""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569610669696}, ""name"": ""get_response""}}, {""path"": ""app._response_synthesizer"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""Refine"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers.refine""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569610669696}, ""name"": ""get_response""}}, {""path"": ""app._response_synthesizer.service_context.llm_predictor"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""LLMPredictor"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.llm_predictor"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.llm_predictor.base""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569659284736}, ""name"": ""predict""}}], ""args"": {""prompt"": {""metadata"": {""prompt_type"": ""text_qa""}, ""template_vars"": [""context_str"", ""query_str""], ""kwargs"": {""query_str"": ""What are the keys to building a career in AI?""}, ""output_parser"": null, ""template_var_mappings"": {}, ""function_mappings"": {}, ""default_template"": {""metadata"": {""prompt_type"": ""text_qa""}, ""template_vars"": [""context_str"", ""query_str""], ""kwargs"": {""query_str"": ""What are the keys to building a career in AI?""}, ""output_parser"": null, ""template_var_mappings"": null, ""function_mappings"": null, ""template"": ""Context information is below.\n---------------------\n{context_str}\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: {query_str}\nAnswer: ""}, ""conditionals"": [[{""__tru_non_serialized_object"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""function"", ""module"": {""package_name"": """", ""module_name"": ""builtins""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140570033230400}}, {""metadata"": {""prompt_type"": ""custom""}, ""template_vars"": [""context_str"", ""query_str""], ""kwargs"": {""query_str"": ""What are the keys to building a career in AI?""}, ""output_parser"": null, ""template_var_mappings"": null, ""function_mappings"": null, ""message_templates"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are an expert Q&A system that is trusted around the world.\nAlways answer the query using the provided context information, and not prior knowledge.\nSome rules to follow:\n1.

A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data.

The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code.

you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate \nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)1. Teamwork:\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \nthat borders on horrific. I\u2019d much rather stay home and read \na book. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fortunate to have found many \ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \nand who I count on as well. No person is an island, and \nhaving a strong professional network can help propel you \nforward in the moments when you need help or advice. In \nlieu of networking, I\u2019ve found it more helpful to think about \nbuilding up a community. So instead of trying to build up \nmy personal network, I focus instead on building up the \ncommunities that I\u2019m part of. This has the side effect of \nhelping me meet more people and make friends as well. 2. Networking:\n\n\nPAGE 36Keys to Building a Career in AI CHAPTER 10\nOf all the steps in building a career, this \none tends to receive the most attention. \nUnfortunately, there is a lot of bad advice \nabout this on the internet. (For example, many \narticles urge taking an adversarial attitude \ntoward potential employers, which I don\u2019t think \nis helpful.) Although it may seem like finding a \njob is the ultimate goal, it\u2019s just one small step \nin the long journey of a career.3. Job search\nFew people will know whether you spend \nyour weekends learning, or binge watching \nTV \u2014 but they will notice the difference over \ntime. Many successful people develop good \nhabits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal \nrelationships, work, learning, and self-care. \nSuch habits help them move forward while \nstaying healthy.4. Personal discipline\nI find that people  who aim to lift others during \nevery step of their own journey often achieve \nbetter outcomes for themselves.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward. \nOver many years, I\u2019ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in \ncompanies large and small, navigate careers in AI.\n \nHere\u2019s a framework for charting your own course.\nLater, you will work \non finding a job. \nThroughout this \nprocess, you\u2019ll continue \nto learn and work on \nmeaningful projects. \nChapters with the\nfocus on a job search.Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to \ndeepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job.

give you momentum to move forward. \nHere are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate \nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)1. Teamwork:\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \nthat borders on horrific. I\u2019d much rather stay home and read \na book. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fortunate to have found many \ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \nand who I count on as well. No person is an island, and \nhaving a strong professional network can help propel you \nforward in the moments when you need help or advice. In \nlieu of networking, I\u2019ve found it more helpful to think about \nbuilding up a community. So instead of trying to build up \nmy personal network, I focus instead on building up the \ncommunities that I\u2019m part of. This has the side effect of \nhelping me meet more people and make friends as well. 2. Networking:\n\n\nPAGE 36Keys to Building a Career in AI CHAPTER 10\nOf all the steps in building a career, this \none tends to receive the most attention. \nUnfortunately, there is a lot of bad advice \nabout this on the internet. (For example, many \narticles urge taking an adversarial attitude \ntoward potential employers, which I don\u2019t think \nis helpful.) Although it may seem like finding a \njob is the ultimate goal, it\u2019s just one small step \nin the long journey of a career.3. Job search\nFew people will know whether you spend \nyour weekends learning, or binge watching \nTV \u2014 but they will notice the difference over \ntime. Many successful people develop good \nhabits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal \nrelationships, work, learning, and self-care. \nSuch habits help them move forward while \nstaying healthy.4. Personal discipline\nI find that people  who aim to lift others during \nevery step of their own journey often achieve \nbetter outcomes for themselves.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field.

give you momentum to move forward. \nHere are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate \nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)1. Teamwork:\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \nthat borders on horrific. I\u2019d much rather stay home and read \na book. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fortunate to have found many \ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \nand who I count on as well. No person is an island, and \nhaving a strong professional network can help propel you \nforward in the moments when you need help or advice. In \nlieu of networking, I\u2019ve found it more helpful to think about \nbuilding up a community. So instead of trying to build up \nmy personal network, I focus instead on building up the \ncommunities that I\u2019m part of. This has the side effect of \nhelping me meet more people and make friends as well. 2. Networking:\n\n\nPAGE 36Keys to Building a Career in AI CHAPTER 10\nOf all the steps in building a career, this \none tends to receive the most attention. \nUnfortunately, there is a lot of bad advice \nabout this on the internet. (For example, many \narticles urge taking an adversarial attitude \ntoward potential employers, which I don\u2019t think \nis helpful.) Although it may seem like finding a \njob is the ultimate goal, it\u2019s just one small step \nin the long journey of a career.3. Job search\nFew people will know whether you spend \nyour weekends learning, or binge watching \nTV \u2014 but they will notice the difference over \ntime. Many successful people develop good \nhabits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal \nrelationships, work, learning, and self-care. \nSuch habits help them move forward while \nstaying healthy.4. Personal discipline\nI find that people  who aim to lift others during \nevery step of their own journey often achieve \nbetter outcomes for themselves.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward. \nOver many years, I\u2019ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in \ncompanies large and small, navigate careers in AI.\n \nHere\u2019s a framework for charting your own course.\nLater, you will work \non finding a job. \nThroughout this \nprocess, you\u2019ll continue \nto learn and work on \nmeaningful projects. \nChapters with the\nfocus on a job search.Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to \ndeepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job.

give you momentum to move forward. \nHere are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate \nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)1. Teamwork:\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \nthat borders on horrific. I\u2019d much rather stay home and read \na book. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fortunate to have found many \ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \nand who I count on as well.

This has the side effect of helping me meet more people and make friends as well.\nScore: 10'}}, {'args': {'source': 'PAGE 1Founder, DeepLearning.AICollected Insights\nfrom Andrew Ng\nHow to \nBuild\nYour\nCareer\nin AIA Simple Guide\n\n\nPAGE 2""AI is the new \nelectricity.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn’t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering — writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute — has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant’s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza — my favorite! — so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field.

(For example, many \narticles urge taking an adversarial attitude \ntoward potential employers, which I don\u2019t think \nis helpful.) Although it may seem like finding a \njob is the ultimate goal, it\u2019s just one small step \nin the long journey of a career.3. Job search\nFew people will know whether you spend \nyour weekends learning, or binge watching \nTV \u2014 but they will notice the difference over \ntime. Many successful people develop good \nhabits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal \nrelationships, work, learning, and self-care. \nSuch habits help them move forward while \nstaying healthy.4. Personal discipline\nI find that people  who aim to lift others during \nevery step of their own journey often achieve \nbetter outcomes for themselves. How can we \nhelp others even as we build an exciting career \nfor ourselves?5.

Even if you have a referral from someone in a \ncompany, a resume and portfolio will be your first contact with many people who don\u2019t already \nknow about you. Update your resume and make sure it clearly presents your education and \nexperience relevant to the role you want. Customize your communications with each company \nto explain why you\u2019re a good fit. Before an interview, ask the recruiter what to expect. Take time \nto review and practice answers to common interview questions, brush up key skills, and study \ntechnical materials to make sure they are fresh in your mind. Afterward, take notes to help you \nremember what was said.\nProceed respectfully and responsibly. Approach interviews and offer negotiations with a win-\nwin mindset. Outrage spreads faster than reasonableness on social media, so a story about \nhow an employer underpaid someone gets amplified, whereas stories about how an employer \ntreated someone fairly do not. The vast majority of employers are ethical and fair, so don\u2019t let \nstories about the small fraction of mistreated individuals sway your approach. If you\u2019re leaving \na job, exit gracefully. Give your employer ample notice, give your full effort through your last \nhour on the job, transition unfinished business as best you can, and leave in a way that honors \nthe responsibilities you were entrusted with.Finding the Right AI Job For You CHAPTER 9\n\nPAGE 33Choose who to work with. It\u2019s tempting to take a position because of the projects you\u2019ll work \non. But the teammates you\u2019ll work with are at least equally important. We\u2019re influenced by \npeople around us, so your colleagues will make a big difference. For example, if your friends \nsmoke, the odds increase that you, too, will smoke. I don\u2019t know of a study that shows this, \nbut I\u2019m pretty sure that if most of your colleagues work hard, learn continuously, and build AI \nto benefit all people, you\u2019re likely to do the same. (By the way, some large companies won\u2019t \ntell you who your teammates will be until you\u2019ve accepted an offer. In this case, be persistent \nand keep pushing to identify and speak with potential teammates. Strict policies may make it \nimpossible to accommodate you, but in my mind, that increases the risk of accepting the offer, \nas it increases the odds you\u2019ll end up with a manager or teammates who aren\u2019t a good fit.)\nGet help from your community. Most of us go job hunting only a small number of times in our \ncareers, so few of us get much practice at doing it well. Collectively, though, people in your \nimmediate community probably have a lot of experience. Don\u2019t be shy about calling on them. \nFriends and associates can provide advice, share inside knowledge, and refer you to others \nwho may help. I got a lot of help from supportive friends and mentors when I applied for my \nfirst faculty position, and many of the tips they gave me were very helpful.\nI know that the job-search process can be intimidating. Instead of viewing it as a great leap, \nconsider an incremental approach. Start by identifying possible roles and conducting a handful \nof informational interviews. If these conversations tell you that you have more learning to do \nbefore you\u2019re ready to apply, that\u2019s great! At least you have a clear path forward. The most \nimportant part of any journey is to take the first step, and that step can be a small one.Finding the Right AI Job For You CHAPTER 9\n\nPAGE 34Keys to Building a \nCareer in AICHAPTER 10\nJOBS\n\nPAGE 35Keys to Building a Career in AI CHAPTER 10\nThe path to career success in AI is more complex than what I can  cover in one short eBook. \nHopefully the previous chapters will give you momentum to move forward. \nHere are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually.

I don’t know of a study that shows this, \nbut I’m pretty sure that if most of your colleagues work hard, learn continuously, and build AI \nto benefit all people, you’re likely to do the same. (By the way, some large companies won’t \ntell you who your teammates will be until you’ve accepted an offer. In this case, be persistent \nand keep pushing to identify and speak with potential teammates.

give you momentum to move forward. \nHere are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate \nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)1. Teamwork:\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \nthat borders on horrific. I\u2019d much rather stay home and read \na book. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fortunate to have found many \ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \nand who I count on as well. No person is an island, and \nhaving a strong professional network can help propel you \nforward in the moments when you need help or advice. In \nlieu of networking, I\u2019ve found it more helpful to think about \nbuilding up a community. So instead of trying to build up \nmy personal network, I focus instead on building up the \ncommunities that I\u2019m part of. This has the side effect of \nhelping me meet more people and make friends as well. 2. Networking:\n\n\nPAGE 36Keys to Building a Career in AI CHAPTER 10\nOf all the steps in building a career, this \none tends to receive the most attention. \nUnfortunately, there is a lot of bad advice \nabout this on the internet. (For example, many \narticles urge taking an adversarial attitude \ntoward potential employers, which I don\u2019t think \nis helpful.) Although it may seem like finding a \njob is the ultimate goal, it\u2019s just one small step \nin the long journey of a career.3. Job search\nFew people will know whether you spend \nyour weekends learning, or binge watching \nTV \u2014 but they will notice the difference over \ntime. Many successful people develop good \nhabits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal \nrelationships, work, learning, and self-care. \nSuch habits help them move forward while \nstaying healthy.4.

Even if you have a referral from someone in a \ncompany, a resume and portfolio will be your first contact with many people who don\u2019t already \nknow about you. Update your resume and make sure it clearly presents your education and \nexperience relevant to the role you want. Customize your communications with each company \nto explain why you\u2019re a good fit. Before an interview, ask the recruiter what to expect. Take time \nto review and practice answers to common interview questions, brush up key skills, and study \ntechnical materials to make sure they are fresh in your mind. Afterward, take notes to help you \nremember what was said.\nProceed respectfully and responsibly. Approach interviews and offer negotiations with a win-\nwin mindset. Outrage spreads faster than reasonableness on social media, so a story about \nhow an employer underpaid someone gets amplified, whereas stories about how an employer \ntreated someone fairly do not. The vast majority of employers are ethical and fair, so don\u2019t let \nstories about the small fraction of mistreated individuals sway your approach. If you\u2019re leaving \na job, exit gracefully. Give your employer ample notice, give your full effort through your last \nhour on the job, transition unfinished business as best you can, and leave in a way that honors \nthe responsibilities you were entrusted with.Finding the Right AI Job For You CHAPTER 9\n\nPAGE 33Choose who to work with. It\u2019s tempting to take a position because of the projects you\u2019ll work \non. But the teammates you\u2019ll work with are at least equally important. We\u2019re influenced by \npeople around us, so your colleagues will make a big difference. For example, if your friends \nsmoke, the odds increase that you, too, will smoke. I don\u2019t know of a study that shows this, \nbut I\u2019m pretty sure that if most of your colleagues work hard, learn continuously, and build AI \nto benefit all people, you\u2019re likely to do the same. (By the way, some large companies won\u2019t \ntell you who your teammates will be until you\u2019ve accepted an offer. In this case, be persistent \nand keep pushing to identify and speak with potential teammates. Strict policies may make it \nimpossible to accommodate you, but in my mind, that increases the risk of accepting the offer, \nas it increases the odds you\u2019ll end up with a manager or teammates who aren\u2019t a good fit.)\nGet help from your community. Most of us go job hunting only a small number of times in our \ncareers, so few of us get much practice at doing it well. Collectively, though, people in your \nimmediate community probably have a lot of experience. Don\u2019t be shy about calling on them. \nFriends and associates can provide advice, share inside knowledge, and refer you to others \nwho may help. I got a lot of help from supportive friends and mentors when I applied for my \nfirst faculty position, and many of the tips they gave me were very helpful.\nI know that the job-search process can be intimidating. Instead of viewing it as a great leap, \nconsider an incremental approach. Start by identifying possible roles and conducting a handful \nof informational interviews. If these conversations tell you that you have more learning to do \nbefore you\u2019re ready to apply, that\u2019s great! At least you have a clear path forward. The most \nimportant part of any journey is to take the first step, and that step can be a small one.Finding the Right AI Job For You CHAPTER 9\n\nPAGE 34Keys to Building a \nCareer in AICHAPTER 10\nJOBS\n\nPAGE 35Keys to Building a Career in AI CHAPTER 10\nThe path to career success in AI is more complex than what I can  cover in one short eBook. \nHopefully the previous chapters will give you momentum to move forward. \nHere are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate \nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)1. Teamwork:\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \nthat borders on horrific. I\u2019d much rather stay home and read \na book. Nonetheless, I\u2019m fortunate to have found many \ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \nand who I count on as well."", ""start_char_idx"": 38059, ""end_char_idx"": 42547,

I don\u2019t know of a study that shows this, \nbut I\u2019m pretty sure that if most of your colleagues work hard, learn continuously, and build AI \nto benefit all people, you\u2019re likely to do the same. (By the way, some large companies won\u2019t \ntell you who your teammates will be until you\u2019ve accepted an offer. In this case, be persistent \nand keep pushing to identify and speak with potential teammates.

Most of us go job hunting only a small number of times in our \ncareers, so few of us get much practice at doing it well. Collectively, though, people in your \nimmediate community probably have a lot of experience. Don\u2019t be shy about calling on them. \nFriends and associates can provide advice, share inside knowledge, and refer you to others \nwho may help. I got a lot of help from supportive friends and mentors when I applied for my \nfirst faculty position, and many of the tips they gave me were very helpful.\nI know that the job-search process can be intimidating. Instead of viewing it as a great leap, \nconsider an incremental approach. Start by identifying possible roles and conducting a handful \nof informational interviews. If these conversations tell you that you have more learning to do \nbefore you\u2019re ready to apply, that\u2019s great! At least you have a clear path forward.

\nSyndromeCHAPTER 11\n\nPAGE 38Before we dive into the final chapter of this book, I\u2019d like to address the serious matter of \nnewcomers to AI sometimes experiencing imposter syndrome, where someone \u2014 regardless \nof their success in the field \u2014 wonders if they\u2019re a fraud and really belong in the AI community. \nI want to make sure this doesn\u2019t discourage you or anyone else from growing in AI.\nAn estimated 70 percent of people experience some form of imposter syndrome at some point. \nMany talented people have spoken publicly about this experience, including former Facebook \nCOO Sheryl Sandberg, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and Atlassian co-CEO \nMike Cannon-Brookes. It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you\u2019ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that\u2019s great! I hope you\u2019ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you\u2019ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone \nwho has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI \ncommunity, then I welcome you with open arms. \nIf you want to join us, you fully belong with us!Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 39My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my \none-year-old son. No matter how far along you are \u2014 if you\u2019re at least as knowledgeable as a \nthree-year-old \u2014 you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let\u2019s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don\u2019t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, \nuse discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don\u2019t support \nyour growth, find ones who do. I\u2019m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community \nand hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.\nNo one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well. If what you do well is \nunderstand and explain to your friends one-tenth of the articles in The Batch,  then you\u2019re \non your way! Let\u2019s work on getting you to understand two-tenths of the articles.\u2713\n\u2713\nOvercoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 40Make Every Day CountFinal Thoughts\nEvery year on my birthday, I get to thinking about the days behind and those \nthat may lie ahead.\nWhen I ask friends, many choose a number in the hundreds of \nthousands. (Many others can\u2019t resist calculating the answer, \nto my annoyance!)\nWhen I was a grad student, I remember plugging my statistics \ninto a mortality calculator to figure out my life expectancy. \nThe calculator said I could expect to live a total of 27,649 \ndays. It struck me how small this number is. I printed it in a \nlarge font and pasted it on my office wall as a daily reminder.\nThat\u2019s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn, \nbuild for the future, and help others. Whatever you\u2019re doing \ntoday, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?How many days is a \ntypical human lifespan?Maybe you\u2019re good at math; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to answer the following question \nvia a quick calculation.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward. \nOver many years, I\u2019ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in \ncompanies large and small, navigate careers in AI.\n \nHere\u2019s a framework for charting your own course.\nLater, you will work \non finding a job. \nThroughout this \nprocess, you\u2019ll continue \nto learn and work on \nmeaningful projects. \nChapters with the\nfocus on a job search.Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to \ndeepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job. These steps stack \non top of each other:Three Steps to Career Growth\nLEARNING PROJECTS JOBCHAPTER 1\nInitially, you \nfocus on learning \nfoundational skills. \nChapters with the \ncover topics about \nlearning foundational \ntechnical skills.

\nSyndromeCHAPTER 11\n\nPAGE 38Before we dive into the final chapter of this book, I\u2019d like to address the serious matter of \nnewcomers to AI sometimes experiencing imposter syndrome, where someone \u2014 regardless \nof their success in the field \u2014 wonders if they\u2019re a fraud and really belong in the AI community. \nI want to make sure this doesn\u2019t discourage you or anyone else from growing in AI.\nAn estimated 70 percent of people experience some form of imposter syndrome at some point. \nMany talented people have spoken publicly about this experience, including former Facebook \nCOO Sheryl Sandberg, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and Atlassian co-CEO \nMike Cannon-Brookes. It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you\u2019ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that\u2019s great! I hope you\u2019ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you\u2019ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone \nwho has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI \ncommunity, then I welcome you with open arms. \nIf you want to join us, you fully belong with us!Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 39My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my \none-year-old son. No matter how far along you are \u2014 if you\u2019re at least as knowledgeable as a \nthree-year-old \u2014 you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let\u2019s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don\u2019t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, \nuse discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don\u2019t support \nyour growth, find ones who do. I\u2019m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community \nand hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.\nNo one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well. If what you do well is \nunderstand and explain to your friends one-tenth of the articles in The Batch,  then you\u2019re \non your way!

(Many others can\u2019t resist calculating the answer, \nto my annoyance!)\nWhen I was a grad student, I remember plugging my statistics \ninto a mortality calculator to figure out my life expectancy. \nThe calculator said I could expect to live a total of 27,649 \ndays. It struck me how small this number is. I printed it in a \nlarge font and pasted it on my office wall as a daily reminder.\nThat\u2019s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn, \nbuild for the future, and help others. Whatever you\u2019re doing \ntoday, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?How many days is a \ntypical human lifespan?Maybe you\u2019re good at math; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to answer the following question \nvia a quick calculation.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain.

It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you’ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that’s great! I hope you’ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you’ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI — congratulations, you’re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it’s okay. We’ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone \nwho has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI \ncommunity, then I welcome you with open arms. \nIf you want to join us, you fully belong with us!Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 39My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my \none-year-old son. No matter how far along you are — if you’re at least as knowledgeable as a \nthree-year-old — you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let’s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don’t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, \nuse discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don’t support \nyour growth, find ones who do. I’m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community \nand hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.\nNo one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well.

like to address the serious matter of \nnewcomers to AI sometimes experiencing imposter syndrome, where someone \u2014 regardless \nof their success in the field \u2014 wonders if they\u2019re a fraud and really belong in the AI community. \nI want to make sure this doesn\u2019t discourage you or anyone else from growing in AI.\nAn estimated 70 percent of people experience some form of imposter syndrome at some point. \nMany talented people have spoken publicly about this experience, including former Facebook \nCOO Sheryl Sandberg, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and Atlassian co-CEO \nMike Cannon-Brookes. It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you\u2019ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that\u2019s great! I hope you\u2019ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you\u2019ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve all been there.

No matter how far along you are \u2014 if you\u2019re at least as knowledgeable as a \nthree-year-old \u2014 you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let\u2019s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don\u2019t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, \nuse discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don\u2019t support \nyour growth, find ones who do. I\u2019m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community \nand hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.\nNo one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well. If what you do well is \nunderstand and explain to your friends one-tenth of the articles in The Batch,  then you\u2019re \non your way! Let\u2019s work on getting you to understand two-tenths of the articles.\u2713\n\u2713\nOvercoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 40Make Every Day CountFinal Thoughts\nEvery year on my birthday, I get to thinking about the days behind and those \nthat may lie ahead.\nWhen I ask friends, many choose a number in the hundreds of \nthousands. (Many others can\u2019t resist calculating the answer, \nto my annoyance!)\nWhen I was a grad student, I remember plugging my statistics \ninto a mortality calculator to figure out my life expectancy. \nThe calculator said I could expect to live a total of 27,649 \ndays. It struck me how small this number is. I printed it in a \nlarge font and pasted it on my office wall as a daily reminder.\nThat\u2019s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn, \nbuild for the future, and help others. Whatever you\u2019re doing \ntoday, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?How many days is a \ntypical human lifespan?Maybe you\u2019re good at math; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to answer the following question \nvia a quick calculation.

If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\nKeep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of \ntime reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I\u2019m confident that you will, too.\nFocus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology \n\u2014 say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language \nmodels \u2014 so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard. But the variety of \napplications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I\u2019m fortunate to \nhave been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to \nonline advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on \nthose applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore \nthe possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative \napplication \u2014 one where you can do unique work \u2014 that no one else has done yet.\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713What if you don\u2019t have any project ideas?\nHere are a few ways to generate them:\n\nPAGE 19Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not \ndevelop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with \ncollaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn\u2019t part of \nmy \u201cjob\u201d (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often \nworked on out of passion for education. My early experiences in recording videos at home \nhelped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley \nabounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. As long as it doesn\u2019t create a \nconflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.\nWill the project help you grow technically? Ideally, it should be challenging enough to \nstretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you \non a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.\nDo you have good teammates to work with? If not, are there people you can discuss things \nwith? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge \nimpact on your growth.\nCan it be a stepping stone?  If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/\nor business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? If the project \nis bigger than those you\u2019ve worked on before, there\u2019s a good chance it could be such a \nstepping stone.\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into? \nHere\u2019s a quick checklist of factors to consider:\nFinally, avoid analysis paralysis. It doesn\u2019t make sense to spend a month deciding whether to \nwork on a project that would take a week to complete. You'll work on multiple projects over \nthe course of your career, so you\u2019ll have ample opportunity to refine your thinking on what\u2019s \nworthwhile. Given the huge number of possible AI projects, rather than the conventional \u201cready, \naim, fire\u201d approach, you can accelerate your progress with \u201cready, fire, aim.\u201dFinding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals CHAPTER 5\n\nPAGE 20Working on projects requires making tough choices about what to build and how to go \nabout it. Here are two distinct styles:\nSay you\u2019ve built a customer-service chatbot for retailers, and you think it could help restaurants, \ntoo. Should you take time to study the restaurant market before starting development, moving \nslowly but cutting the risk of wasting time and resources? Or jump in right away, moving \nquickly and accepting a higher risk of pivoting or failing?\nBoth approaches have their advocates, and the best choice depends on the situation.\nReady, Aim, Fire tends to be superior when the cost of execution is high and a study can shed \nlight on how useful or valuable a project could be. For example, if you can brainstorm a few \nother use cases (restaurants, airlines, telcos, and so on) and evaluate these cases to identify \nthe most promising one, it may be worth taking the extra time before committing to a direction.\nReady, Fire, Aim tends to be better if you can execute at low cost and, in doing so, determine \nwhether the direction is feasible and discover tweaks that will

\nSyndromeCHAPTER 11\n\nPAGE 38Before we dive into the final chapter of this book, I\u2019d like to address the serious matter of \nnewcomers to AI sometimes experiencing imposter syndrome, where someone \u2014 regardless \nof their success in the field \u2014 wonders if they\u2019re a fraud and really belong in the AI community. \nI want to make sure this doesn\u2019t discourage you or anyone else from growing in AI.\nAn estimated 70 percent of people experience some form of imposter syndrome at some point. \nMany talented people have spoken publicly about this experience, including former Facebook \nCOO Sheryl Sandberg, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and Atlassian co-CEO \nMike Cannon-Brookes. It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you\u2019ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that\u2019s great! I hope you\u2019ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you\u2019ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone \nwho has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI \ncommunity, then I welcome you with open arms. \nIf you want to join us, you fully belong with us!Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 39My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my \none-year-old son. No matter how far along you are \u2014 if you\u2019re at least as knowledgeable as a \nthree-year-old \u2014 you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let\u2019s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don\u2019t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, \nuse discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don\u2019t support \nyour growth, find ones who do. I\u2019m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community \nand hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.\nNo one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well. If what you do well is \nunderstand and explain to your friends one-tenth of the articles in The Batch,  then you\u2019re \non your way! Let\u2019s work on getting you to understand two-tenths of the articles.\u2713\n\u2713\nOvercoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 40Make Every Day CountFinal Thoughts\nEvery year on my birthday, I get to thinking about the days behind and those \nthat may lie ahead.\nWhen I ask friends, many choose a number in the hundreds of \nthousands. (Many others can\u2019t resist calculating the answer, \nto my annoyance!)\nWhen I was a grad student, I remember plugging my statistics \ninto a mortality calculator to figure out my life expectancy. \nThe calculator said I could expect to live a total of 27,649 \ndays. It struck me how small this number is. I printed it in a \nlarge font and pasted it on my office wall as a daily reminder.\nThat\u2019s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn, \nbuild for the future, and help others. Whatever you\u2019re doing \ntoday, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?How many days is a \ntypical human lifespan?Maybe you\u2019re good at math; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to answer the following question \nvia a quick calculation.

If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\nKeep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of \ntime reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I\u2019m confident that you will, too.\nFocus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology \n\u2014 say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language \nmodels \u2014 so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard. But the variety of \napplications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I\u2019m fortunate to \nhave been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to \nonline advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on \nthose applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore \nthe possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative \napplication \u2014 one where you can do unique work \u2014 that no one else has done yet.\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713What if you don\u2019t have any project ideas?\nHere are a few ways to generate them:\n\nPAGE 19Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not \ndevelop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with \ncollaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn\u2019t part of \nmy \u201cjob\u201d (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often \nworked on out of passion for education. My early experiences in recording videos at home \nhelped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley \nabounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. As long as it doesn\u2019t create a \nconflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.\nWill the project help you grow technically? Ideally, it should be challenging enough to \nstretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you \non a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.\nDo you have good teammates to work with? If not, are there people you can discuss things \nwith? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge \nimpact on your growth.\nCan it be a stepping stone?  If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/\nor business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? If the project \nis bigger than those you\u2019ve worked on before, there\u2019s a good chance it could be such a \nstepping stone.\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into? \nHere\u2019s a quick checklist of factors to consider:\nFinally, avoid analysis paralysis. It doesn\u2019t make sense to spend a month deciding whether to \nwork on a project that would take a week to complete. You'll work on multiple projects over \nthe course of your career, so you\u2019ll have ample opportunity to refine your thinking on what\u2019s \nworthwhile. Given the huge number of possible AI projects, rather than the conventional \u201cready, \naim, fire\u201d approach, you can accelerate your progress with \u201cready, fire, aim.\u201dFinding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals CHAPTER 5\n\nPAGE 20Working on projects requires making tough choices about what to build and how to go \nabout it. Here are two distinct styles:\nSay you\u2019ve built a customer-service chatbot for retailers, and you think it could help restaurants, \ntoo.

It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you’ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that’s great! I hope you’ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you’ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI — congratulations, you’re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it’s okay. We’ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone \nwho has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI \ncommunity, then I welcome you with open arms. \nIf you want to join us, you fully belong with us!Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 39My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my \none-year-old son. No matter how far along you are — if you’re at least as knowledgeable as a \nthree-year-old — you can encourage and lift up others behind you. Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let’s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don’t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, \nuse discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don’t support \nyour growth, find ones who do. I’m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community \nand hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.\nNo one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well.

It struck me how small this number is. I printed it in a \nlarge font and pasted it on my office wall as a daily reminder.\nThat’s all the days we have to spend with loved ones, learn, \nbuild for the future, and help others. Whatever you’re doing \ntoday, is it worth 1/30,000 of your life?How many days is a \ntypical human lifespan?Maybe you’re good at math; I’m sure you’ll be able to answer the following question \nvia a quick calculation.

If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\nKeep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of \ntime reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’m confident that you will, too.\nFocus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology \n— say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language \nmodels — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard. But the variety of \napplications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate to \nhave been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to \nonline advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on \nthose applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore \nthe possibilities for machine learning.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code.

While the \nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing \u2014 \nand coursework is an efficient way to master them \u2014 beyond these \nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project\u2019s \ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \nwhen you don\u2019t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \nwho have them. Things you\u2019ve worked on may be significantly different \nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you\u2019re more likely to have to \neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: CHAPTER 1\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and \nallies who can help you \u2014 and who you strive to help \u2014 makes the path easier. This is true whether \nyou\u2019re taking your first steps or you\u2019ve been on the journey for years.LEARNING\nPROJECTS\nJOB\n\nPAGE 8Learning Technical \nSkills for a Promising \nAI CareerCHAPTER 2\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 9In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I\u2019d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \nlearning foundational skills.\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \nlearning, it\u2019s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \ncareer in machine learning are:\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it\u2019s important to understand models such \nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \ndetection. Beyond specific models, it\u2019s even more important to understand the core concepts \nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it\u2019s hard to excel \nin the field without some understanding of it! It\u2019s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \nsequence models, and transformers.\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \nto implement complex AI systems."", ""start_char_idx"": 3787, ""end_char_idx"": 8094, ""text_template"": ""{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"", ""metadata_template"": ""{key}: {value}"",

This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward. \nOver many years, I\u2019ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in \ncompanies large and small, navigate careers in AI.\n \nHere\u2019s a framework for charting your own course.\nLater, you will work \non finding a job. \nThroughout this \nprocess, you\u2019ll continue \nto learn and work on \nmeaningful projects. \nChapters with the\nfocus on a job search.Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to \ndeepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job.

While the \nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing \u2014 \nand coursework is an efficient way to master them \u2014 beyond these \nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project\u2019s \ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \nwhen you don\u2019t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \nwho have them. Things you\u2019ve worked on may be significantly different \nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you\u2019re more likely to have to \neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: CHAPTER 1\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and \nallies who can help you \u2014 and who you strive to help \u2014 makes the path easier. This is true whether \nyou\u2019re taking your first steps or you\u2019ve been on the journey for years.LEARNING\nPROJECTS\nJOB\n\nPAGE 8Learning Technical \nSkills for a Promising \nAI CareerCHAPTER 2\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 9In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I\u2019d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \nlearning foundational skills.\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \nlearning, it\u2019s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \ncareer in machine learning are:\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it\u2019s important to understand models such \nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \ndetection. Beyond specific models, it\u2019s even more important to understand the core concepts \nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it\u2019s hard to excel \nin the field without some understanding of it! It\u2019s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \nsequence models, and transformers.\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \nto implement complex AI systems."", ""start_char_idx"": 3787, ""end_char_idx"": 8094, ""text_template"": ""{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"", ""metadata_template"": ""{key}: {value}"", ""metadata_seperator"": ""\n""}, ""score"": 0.7060877294922177}], ""error"": null, ""perf"": {""start_time"": ""2023-12-04T21:57:44.087182"", ""end_time"": ""2023-12-04T21:57:44.277164""}, ""pid"": 27527, ""tid"": 982873}, {""stack"": [{""path"": ""app"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""RetrieverQueryEngine"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.query_engine"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.query_engine.retriever_query_engine""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569370214352}, ""name"": ""query""}}, {""path"": ""app._response_synthesizer"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""CompactAndRefine"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers.compact_and_refine""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569610669696}, ""name"": ""get_response""}}, {""path"": ""app._response_synthesizer"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""Refine"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.response_synthesizers.refine""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569610669696}, ""name"": ""get_response""}}, {""path"": ""app._response_synthesizer.service_context.llm_predictor"", ""method"": {""obj"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""LLMPredictor"", ""module"": {""package_name"": ""llama_index.llm_predictor"", ""module_name"": ""llama_index.llm_predictor.base""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140569659284736}, ""name"": ""predict""}}], ""args"": {""prompt"": {""metadata"": {""prompt_type"": ""text_qa""}, ""template_vars"": [""context_str"", ""query_str""], ""kwargs"": {""query_str"": ""What is the first step to becoming good at AI?""}, ""output_parser"": null, ""template_var_mappings"": {}, ""function_mappings"": {}, ""default_template"": {""metadata"": {""prompt_type"": ""text_qa""}, ""template_vars"": [""context_str"", ""query_str""], ""kwargs"": {""query_str"": ""What is the first step to becoming good at AI?""}, ""output_parser"": null, ""template_var_mappings"": null, ""function_mappings"": null, ""template"": ""Context information is below.\n---------------------\n{context_str}\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: {query_str}\nAnswer: ""}, ""conditionals"": [[{""__tru_non_serialized_object"": {""cls"": {""name"": ""function"", ""module"": {""package_name"": """", ""module_name"": ""builtins""}, ""bases"": null}, ""id"": 140570033230400}}, {""metadata"": {""prompt_type"": ""custom""}, ""template_vars"": [""context_str"", ""query_str""], ""kwargs"": {""query_str"": ""What is the first step to becoming good at AI?""}, ""output_parser"": null, ""template_var_mappings"": null, ""function_mappings"": null, ""message_templates"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are an expert Q&A system that is trusted around the world.\nAlways answer the query using the provided context information, and not prior knowledge.\nSome rules to follow:\n1.

Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \nwho have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different \nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to \neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: CHAPTER 1\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and \nallies who can help you — and who you strive to help — makes the path easier. This is true whether \nyou’re taking your first steps or you’ve been on the journey for years.LEARNING\nPROJECTS\nJOB\n\nPAGE 8Learning Technical \nSkills for a Promising \nAI CareerCHAPTER 2\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 9In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I’d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \nlearning foundational skills.\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \nlearning, it’s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \ncareer in machine learning are:\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it’s important to understand models such \nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \ndetection. Beyond specific models, it’s even more important to understand the core concepts \nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it’s hard to excel \nin the field without some understanding of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \nsequence models, and transformers.\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \nto implement complex AI systems.', 'statement': 'The first step to becoming good at AI is learning foundational technical skills. This includes understanding models such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly detection. It is also important to grasp the core concepts behind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, optimization algorithms, and error analysis.

When I was younger, I used to \nexecute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes \nthis worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing \nan even better idea that might not have taken any more \neffort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can \nbrainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, \nto predict power generation from intermittent sources, we \nmight consider using satellite imagery to map the locations \nof wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery \nto estimate the height and generation capacity of wind \nturbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover \nand thus solar irradiance. Sometimes there isn\u2019t a good AI \nsolution, and that\u2019s okay too.Scoping Successful AI Projects CHAPTER 4\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\n\nPAGE 16Determine milestones. Once you\u2019ve deemed a project sufficiently \nvaluable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This \nincludes both machine learning metrics (such as accuracy) and \nbusiness metrics (such as revenue). Machine learning teams are often \nmost comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize. \nBut we may need to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up \nwith business metrics, such as those related to user engagement, \nrevenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be \nreduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren\u2019t able to determine \nreasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more \nabout the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the \nmissing perspective.Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions. You can determine \nwhether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work, \nwhat competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept \nimplementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain \nexperts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the \npotential solutions mentioned above).\nBudget for resources. Think through everything you\u2019ll need to get the \nproject done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or \nsupport you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds \nto purchase satellite imagery, make sure that\u2019s in the budget.\nWorking on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is \ninfeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. Is there a domain \nthat excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it \nthrough project work \u2014 even if you don\u2019t yet have deep expertise in that field. AI won\u2019t solve every \nproblem, but as a community, let\u2019s look for ways to make a positive impact wherever we can.Scoping Successful AI Projects CHAPTER 4\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\n\nPAGE 17Finding Projects that \nComplement Your \nCareer GoalsCHAPTER 5\nPROJECTS\n\nPAGE 18It goes without saying that we should only work on projects that are responsible, ethical, and \nbeneficial to people. But those limits leave a large variety to choose from. In the previous chapter, \nI wrote about how to identify and scope AI projects. This chapter and the next have a slightly \ndifferent emphasis: picking and executing projects with an eye toward career development.\nA fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact \nover time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to \nbigger projects as your skills grow.\nWhen you\u2019re starting out, don\u2019t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter. \nMany people start by working on small projects in their spare time. With initial successes \u2014 even \nsmall ones \u2014 under your belt, your growing skills increase your ability to come up with better \nideas, and it becomes easier to persuade others to help you step up to bigger projects.Finding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals CHAPTER 5\nJoin existing projects. If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\nKeep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of \ntime reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I\u2019m confident that you will, too.\nFocus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology \n\u2014 say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language \nmodels \u2014 so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard.

It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you\u2019ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that\u2019s great! I hope you\u2019ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you\u2019ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone \nwho has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI \ncommunity, then I welcome you with open arms. \nIf you want to join us, you fully belong with us!Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 39My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my \none-year-old son.

Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let\u2019s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers?

\nSyndromeCHAPTER 11\n\nPAGE 38Before we dive into the final chapter of this book, I\u2019d like to address the serious matter of \nnewcomers to AI sometimes experiencing imposter syndrome, where someone \u2014 regardless \nof their success in the field \u2014 wonders if they\u2019re a fraud and really belong in the AI community. \nI want to make sure this doesn\u2019t discourage you or anyone else from growing in AI.\nAn estimated 70 percent of people experience some form of imposter syndrome at some point. \nMany talented people have spoken publicly about this experience, including former Facebook \nCOO Sheryl Sandberg, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, actor Tom Hanks, and Atlassian co-CEO \nMike Cannon-Brookes. It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you\u2019ve \nnever experienced this yourself, that\u2019s great! I hope you\u2019ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \neveryone who wants to join our community.\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you\u2019ve succeeded \nat sucking at AI \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019re on your way!\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve all been there. I guarantee that everyone \nwho has published a seminal AI paper struggled with similar technical challenges at some point.Let me be clear: If you want to be part of the AI \ncommunity, then I welcome you with open arms. \nIf you want to join us, you fully belong with us!Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\n\nPAGE 39My three-year-old daughter (who can barely count to 12) regularly tries to teach things to my \none-year-old son.

Doing so will help you, too, \nas others behind you will recognize your expertise and also encourage you to keep developing. \nWhen you invite others to join the AI community, which I hope you will do, it also reduces any \ndoubts that you are already one of us.\nAI is such an important part of our world that I would like everyone who wants to be part of it \nto feel at home as a member of our community. Let\u2019s work together to make it happen.Here are some things that can help.\nDo you have supportive mentors or peers? If you don\u2019t yet, attend Pie & AI or other events, \nuse discussion boards, and work on finding some. If your mentors or manager don\u2019t support \nyour growth, find ones who do. I\u2019m also working on how to grow a supportive AI community \nand hope to make finding and giving support easier for everyone.\nNo one is an expert at everything. Recognize what you do well. If what you do well is \nunderstand and explain to your friends one-tenth of the articles in The Batch,  then you\u2019re \non your way!

It struck me how small this number is.

CHAPTER 3\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 13Should you Learn Math to Get a Job in AI? CHAPTER 3\nIs math a foundational skill for AI? It\u2019s always nice to know more math! But there\u2019s so much to \nlearn that, realistically, it\u2019s necessary to prioritize. Here\u2019s how you might go about strengthening \nyour math background.\nTo figure out what\u2019s important to know, I find it useful to ask what you need to know to make \nthe decisions required for the work you want to do. At DeepLearning.AI, we frequently ask, \n\u201cWhat does someone need to know to accomplish their goals?\u201d The goal might be building a \nmachine learning model, architecting a system, or passing a job interview.\nUnderstanding the math behind algorithms you use is often helpful, since it enables you to \ndebug them. But the depth of knowledge that\u2019s useful changes over time. As machine learning \ntechniques mature and become more reliable and turnkey, they require less debugging, and a \nshallower understanding of the math involved may be sufficient to make them work.\nFor instance, in an earlier era of machine learning, linear algebra libraries for solving linear \nsystems of equations (for linear regression) were immature. I had to understand how these \nlibraries worked so I could choose among different libraries and avoid numerical roundoff \npitfalls. But this became less important as numerical linear algebra libraries matured.\nDeep learning is still an emerging technology, so when you train a neural network and the \noptimization algorithm struggles to converge, understanding the math behind gradient \ndescent, momentum, and the Adam  optimization algorithm will help you make better decisions. \nSimilarly, if your neural network does something funny \u2014 say, it makes bad predictions on \nimages of a certain resolution, but not others \u2014 understanding the math behind neural network \narchitectures puts you in a better position to figure out what to do.\nOf course, I also encourage learning driven by curiosity. If something interests you, go ahead \nand learn it regardless of how useful it might turn out to be!  Maybe this will lead to a creative \nspark or technical breakthrough.How much math do you need to know to be a machine learning engineer?\n\nPAGE 14Scoping Successful \nAI ProjectsCHAPTER 4\nPROJECTS\n\nPAGE 15One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth \nworking on. These next few chapters will discuss finding and working on projects so you can gain \nexperience and build your portfolio. \nOver the years, I\u2019ve had fun applying machine learning to manufacturing, healthcare, climate \nchange, agriculture, ecommerce, advertising, and other industries. How can someone who\u2019s not \nan expert in all these sectors find meaningful projects within them? Here are five steps to help \nyou scope projects.\nIdentify a business problem (not an AI problem). I like to find \na domain expert and ask, \u201cWhat are the top three things \nthat you wish worked better? Why aren\u2019t they working yet?\u201d \nFor example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you \nmight discover that power-grid operators can\u2019t accurately \npredict how much power intermittent sources like wind \nand solar might generate in the future.\nBrainstorm AI solutions. When I was younger, I used to \nexecute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes \nthis worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing \nan even better idea that might not have taken any more \neffort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can \nbrainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, \nto predict power generation from intermittent sources, we \nmight consider using satellite imagery to map the locations \nof wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery \nto estimate the height and generation capacity of wind \nturbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover \nand thus solar irradiance. Sometimes there isn\u2019t a good AI \nsolution, and that\u2019s okay too.Scoping Successful AI Projects CHAPTER 4\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\n\nPAGE 16Determine milestones."", ""start_char_idx"": 11342,

Here\u2019s how you might go about strengthening \nyour math background.\nTo figure out what\u2019s important to know, I find it useful to ask what you need to know to make \nthe decisions required for the work you want to do. At DeepLearning.AI, we frequently ask, \n\u201cWhat does someone need to know to accomplish their goals?\u201d The goal might be building a \nmachine learning model, architecting a system, or passing a job interview.\nUnderstanding the math behind algorithms you use is often helpful, since it enables you to \ndebug them. But the depth of knowledge that\u2019s useful changes over time. As machine learning \ntechniques mature and become more reliable and turnkey, they require less debugging, and a \nshallower understanding of the math involved may be sufficient to make them work.\nFor instance, in an earlier era of machine learning, linear algebra libraries for solving linear \nsystems of equations (for linear regression) were immature. I had to understand how these \nlibraries worked so I could choose among different libraries and avoid numerical roundoff \npitfalls. But this became less important as numerical linear algebra libraries matured.\nDeep learning is still an emerging technology, so when you train a neural network and the \noptimization algorithm struggles to converge, understanding the math behind gradient \ndescent, momentum, and the Adam  optimization algorithm will help you make better decisions. \nSimilarly, if your neural network does something funny \u2014 say, it makes bad predictions on \nimages of a certain resolution, but not others \u2014 understanding the math behind neural network \narchitectures puts you in a better position to figure out what to do.\nOf course, I also encourage learning driven by curiosity. If something interests you, go ahead \nand learn it regardless of how useful it might turn out to be!  Maybe this will lead to a creative \nspark or technical breakthrough.How much math do you need to know to be a machine learning engineer?\n\nPAGE 14Scoping Successful \nAI ProjectsCHAPTER 4\nPROJECTS\n\nPAGE 15One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth \nworking on.

When I was younger, I used to \nexecute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes \nthis worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing \nan even better idea that might not have taken any more \neffort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can \nbrainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, \nto predict power generation from intermittent sources, we \nmight consider using satellite imagery to map the locations \nof wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery \nto estimate the height and generation capacity of wind \nturbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover \nand thus solar irradiance.

At DeepLearning.AI, we frequently ask, \n\u201cWhat does someone need to know to accomplish their goals?\u201d The goal might be building a \nmachine learning model, architecting a system, or passing a job interview.\nUnderstanding the math behind algorithms you use is often helpful, since it enables you to \ndebug them. But the depth of knowledge that\u2019s useful changes over time. As machine learning \ntechniques mature and become more reliable and turnkey, they require less debugging, and a \nshallower understanding of the math involved may be sufficient to make them work.\nFor instance, in an earlier era of machine learning, linear algebra libraries for solving linear \nsystems of equations (for linear regression) were immature. I had to understand how these \nlibraries worked so I could choose among different libraries and avoid numerical roundoff \npitfalls. But this became less important as numerical linear algebra libraries matured.\nDeep learning is still an emerging technology, so when you train a neural network and the \noptimization algorithm struggles to converge, understanding the math behind gradient \ndescent, momentum, and the Adam  optimization algorithm will help you make better decisions. \nSimilarly, if your neural network does something funny \u2014 say, it makes bad predictions on \nimages of a certain resolution, but not others \u2014 understanding the math behind neural network \narchitectures puts you in a better position to figure out what to do.\nOf course, I also encourage learning driven by curiosity. If something interests you, go ahead \nand learn it regardless of how useful it might turn out to be!  Maybe this will lead to a creative \nspark or technical breakthrough.How much math do you need to know to be a machine learning engineer?\n\nPAGE 14Scoping Successful \nAI ProjectsCHAPTER 4\nPROJECTS\n\nPAGE 15One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth \nworking on. These next few chapters will discuss finding and working on projects so you can gain \nexperience and build your portfolio. \nOver the years, I\u2019ve had fun applying machine learning to manufacturing, healthcare, climate \nchange, agriculture, ecommerce, advertising, and other industries. How can someone who\u2019s not \nan expert in all these sectors find meaningful projects within them? Here are five steps to help \nyou scope projects.\nIdentify a business problem (not an AI problem). I like to find \na domain expert and ask, \u201cWhat are the top three things \nthat you wish worked better? Why aren\u2019t they working yet?\u201d \nFor example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you \nmight discover that power-grid operators can\u2019t accurately \npredict how much power intermittent sources like wind \nand solar might generate in the future.\nBrainstorm AI solutions. When I was younger, I used to \nexecute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes \nthis worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing \nan even better idea that might not have taken any more \neffort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can \nbrainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, \nto predict power generation from intermittent sources, we \nmight consider using satellite imagery to map the locations \nof wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery \nto estimate the height and generation capacity of wind \nturbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover \nand thus solar irradiance.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward. \nOver many years, I\u2019ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in \ncompanies large and small, navigate careers in AI.\n \nHere\u2019s a framework for charting your own course.\nLater, you will work \non finding a job. \nThroughout this \nprocess, you\u2019ll continue \nto learn and work on \nmeaningful projects. \nChapters with the\nfocus on a job search.Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to \ndeepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job.

If you\u2019re able to help with AI tasks \u2014 even if it\u2019s not your official job \u2014 your work is likely \nto be appreciated. This lays the groundwork for a possible role switch without needing to leave \nthe company. In contrast, in a big company, a rigid reward system is more likely to reward you \nfor doing your job well (and your manager for supporting you in doing the job for which you were \nhired), but it\u2019s not as likely to reward contributions outside your job\u2019s scope.\nAfter working for a while in your desired role and industry (for example, a machine learning \nengineer in a tech company), you\u2019ll have a good sense of the requirements for that role in that \nindustry at a more senior level. You\u2019ll also have a network within that industry to help you along. \nSo future job searches \u2014 if you choose to stick with the role and industry \u2014 likely will be easier.\nWhen changing jobs, you\u2019re taking a step into the unknown, particularly if you\u2019re switching either \nroles or industries. One of the most underused tools for becoming more familiar with a new role \nand/or industry is the informational interview. I\u2019ll share more about that in the next chapter.\nI\u2019m grateful to Salwa Nur Muhammad, CEO of FourthBrain (a DeepLearning.AI affiliate), for providing \nsome of the ideas presented in this chapter.\n\n\nPAGE 27There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about the future: When will we cure Alzheimer\u2019s disease? Who will \nwin the next election? Or, in a business context, how many customers will we have next year?\nWith so many changes going on in the world, many people are feeling stressed about the \nfuture, especially when it comes to finding a job. I have a practice that helps me regain a sense \nof control. Faced with uncertainty, I try to:\nFor example, during the Covid-19 pandemic back in March 2020, I did this scenario planning \nexercise. I imagined quick (three months), medium (one year), and slow (two years) recoveries \nfrom Covid-19 and made plans for managing each case. These plans have helped me prioritize \nwhere I can.\nThe same method can apply to personal life, too. If you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll pass an exam, get a \njob offer, or be granted a visa \u2014 all of which can be stressful \u2014 you can write out what you\u2019d \ndo in each of the likely scenarios. Thinking through the possibilities and following through on \nplans can help you navigate the future effectively no matter what it brings.\nBonus: With training in AI and statistics, you can calculate a probability for each scenario. \nI\u2019m a fan of the Superforecasting methodology, in which the judgments of many experts are \nsynthesized into a probability estimate. Overcoming Uncertainty\nMake a list of plausible scenarios, \nacknowledging that I don\u2019t know \nwhich will come to pass.Create a plan of action \nfor each scenario.\nStart executing actions \nthat seem reasonable.Review scenarios and plans \nperiodically as the future \ncomes into focus.1 2\n3 4\n\nPAGE 28Using Informational \nInterviews to Find \nthe Right JobCHAPTER 8\nJOBS\n\nPAGE 29If you\u2019re preparing to switch roles (say, taking a job as a machine learning engineer for the first \ntime) or industries (say, working in an AI tech company for the first time), there\u2019s a lot about \nyour target job that you probably don\u2019t know. A technique known as informational interviewing \nis a great way to learn.\nAn informational interview involves finding someone in a company or role you\u2019d like to know \nmore about and informally interviewing them about their work. Such conversations are separate \nfrom searching for a job. In fact, it\u2019s helpful to interview people who hold positions that align \nwith your interests well before you\u2019re ready to kick off a job search.\nPrepare for informational interviews by researching the interviewee and company in advance, \nso you can arrive with thoughtful questions. You might ask:Informational interviews are particularly relevant to AI.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding.

Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn’t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering — writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute — has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant’s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza — my favorite! — so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not straightforward. \nOver many years, I’ve been privileged to see thousands of students, as well as engineers in \ncompanies large and small, navigate careers in AI.\n \nHere’s a framework for charting your own course.\nLater, you will work \non finding a job. \nThroughout this \nprocess, you’ll continue \nto learn and work on \nmeaningful projects. \nChapters with the\nfocus on a job search.Three key steps of career growth are learning foundational skills, working on projects (to \ndeepen your skills, build a portfolio, and create impact), and finding a job.

If you’re able to help with AI tasks — even if it’s not your official job — your work is likely \nto be appreciated. This lays the groundwork for a possible role switch without needing to leave \nthe company. In contrast, in a big company, a rigid reward system is more likely to reward you \nfor doing your job well (and your manager for supporting you in doing the job for which you were \nhired), but it’s not as likely to reward contributions outside your job’s scope.\nAfter working for a while in your desired role and industry (for example, a machine learning \nengineer in a tech company), you’ll have a good sense of the requirements for that role in that \nindustry at a more senior level. You’ll also have a network within that industry to help you along. \nSo future job searches — if you choose to stick with the role and industry — likely will be easier.\nWhen changing jobs, you’re taking a step into the unknown, particularly if you’re switching either \nroles or industries. One of the most underused tools for becoming more familiar with a new role \nand/or industry is the informational interview. I’ll share more about that in the next chapter.\nI’m grateful to Salwa Nur Muhammad, CEO of FourthBrain (a DeepLearning.AI affiliate), for providing \nsome of the ideas presented in this chapter.\n\n\nPAGE 27There’s a lot we don’t know about the future: When will we cure Alzheimer’s disease? Who will \nwin the next election? Or, in a business context, how many customers will we have next year?\nWith so many changes going on in the world, many people are feeling stressed about the \nfuture, especially when it comes to finding a job. I have a practice that helps me regain a sense \nof control. Faced with uncertainty, I try to:\nFor example, during the Covid-19 pandemic back in March 2020, I did this scenario planning \nexercise. I imagined quick (three months), medium (one year), and slow (two years) recoveries \nfrom Covid-19 and made plans for managing each case. These plans have helped me prioritize \nwhere I can.\nThe same method can apply to personal life, too. If you’re not sure you’ll pass an exam, get a \njob offer, or be granted a visa — all of which can be stressful — you can write out what you’d \ndo in each of the likely scenarios. Thinking through the possibilities and following through on \nplans can help you navigate the future effectively no matter what it brings.\nBonus: With training in AI and statistics, you can calculate a probability for each scenario. \nI’m a fan of the Superforecasting methodology, in which the judgments of many experts are \nsynthesized into a probability estimate. Overcoming Uncertainty\nMake a list of plausible scenarios, \nacknowledging that I don’t know \nwhich will come to pass.Create a plan of action \nfor each scenario.\nStart executing actions \nthat seem reasonable.Review scenarios and plans \nperiodically as the future \ncomes into focus.1 2\n3 4\n\nPAGE 28Using Informational \nInterviews to Find \nthe Right JobCHAPTER 8\nJOBS\n\nPAGE 29If you’re preparing to switch roles (say, taking a job as a machine learning engineer for the first \ntime) or industries (say, working in an AI tech company for the first time), there’s a lot about \nyour target job that you probably don’t know. A technique known as informational interviewing \nis a great way to learn.\nAn informational interview involves finding someone in a company or role you’d like to know \nmore about and informally interviewing them about their work. Such conversations are separate \nfrom searching for a job. In fact, it’s helpful to interview people who hold positions that align \nwith your interests well before you’re ready to kick off a job search.\nPrepare for informational interviews by researching the interviewee and company in advance, \nso you can arrive with thoughtful questions. You might ask:Informational interviews are particularly relevant to AI.
